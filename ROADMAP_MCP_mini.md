📋 IMPLEMENTATION REFERENCE
The documentation now serves as a complete reference for:

Future Developers - Understanding the API bridge architecture
Debugging - Step-by-step troubleshooting guide with common errors
Extension - How to add new API methods and capabilities
Testing - Verification procedures and expected results
Integration - Ready foundation for Phase 2 MCP implementation
🚀 READY FOR PHASE 2
With this solid documentation foundation, we're perfectly positioned for:

MCP Server Implementation - Connecting the working API bridge to MCP protocol
Tool Auto-Registration - Converting existing API components to MCP tools
WebLLM Integration - Function calling with real desktop components
The Python-Desktop API Bridge is now a production-ready foundation for the entire MCP integration roadmap! 🎉

Next step when ready: Implement MCP Protocol with JSON-RPC 2.0 handler and tool registration system, building on this solid API bridge foundation.
